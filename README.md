# Using CNNs to Predict Protein-Ligand Binding Affinities

Understanding the mechanisms of protein-ligand binding in the human body is an endeavour vital to the design of effective drug interventions for diseases. This task is mostly carried out in wet labs over ling periods of time, and using Machine Learning as a tool to predict protein-ligand binding affinities can considerably speed up the process of drug design.

In the summer of 2018, I interned with [Dr. Karthik Raman](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab/karthik/) at his lab at Indian Institue of Technology, Madras. Here, I studied how the pattern-detection capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks could help to predict protein-ligand binding affinities from their 3D structures. The report I compiled for this project, after some extensive literature surveys and algorithm implementations, can be found in this repository.
